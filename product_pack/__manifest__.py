Product Pack
================
Based on INGADHOC's product_pack, Improved and fixed some features.
currently this module is doing the following:
- allow configuring a product as a package or bundle that contains multiple products
- adding a package to sale order, will add its components to the sale order if it's a detailed package
- we can select one of four package types for sale orders:
    - Detailed - component prices: show component prices and the pack price is zero
    - ... ToDo: complete the description...

DVIT Improvments:
- The package product is always a service - enforced.
- Non fixed price packages have their sale price calculated automatically and enforced.
- Package lines on Pack tab on product form have price & Subtotal price on each line plus package total - lst_price
- updating a component product sale price will update all packages' sale prices that contain this component
- On sale order if we remove a line that's part of a package - the package price will be updated
- On sale order every line have the original product price as reference
- Package line discounts is useless - so removed
- Non-detailed packages now creates warehouse moves and pickings for its components
- Packages are now supported on the Point of Sale using product_pack_pos module
